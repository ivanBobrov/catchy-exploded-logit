## Abstract

Estimating a song's potential success is an important task in the music industry. Assessing songs and evaluating them brings a lot of valuable information for musicians, performers, music producers and everybody involved in music production and distribution. This task, however, is difficult. The audio stream contains raw data that is hard to interpret and analyze. Music information retrieval (MIR) techniques consider a list of features and metrics that can be used as a basis for analysis and prediction. These techniques use signal processing algorithms combined with models of the human ear and its perceptual characteristics to extract features that reflect significant qualities and attributes of the audio sample. These features can be used in linear and non-linear models to analyze and predict songs' potential success. It is convenient to use song competitions to have a numerical estimation of song success and to try to predict a winner. 

In this paper we select a particular set of features and suggest using an exploded logit model to predict song rankings based on judges' decisions, instead of determining the winner only. To test our approach we apply the model to the raw audio and song scores divided by countries obtained from Eurovision Song Contest for the period 1975 to 2019. We use this Eurovision dataset to predict the results of the Eurovision 2021, to be held in Rotterdam.
